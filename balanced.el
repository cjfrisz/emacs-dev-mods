;; Provides a modifier to major modes such that ``parenthesis''-type
;; characters usually stay balanced.  See the documentation-string for
;; ``balanced-on'' for details.  After putting this file somewhere in
;; your load-path, A not-bad thing to do with this package is:

;; (require 'balanced)
;; (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook 'balanced-on)

;; ------------------------------

;; This file provides the package named ``balanced''.  When
;; compiled, if it contains macros, it should require itself to be
;; loaded before the program is compiled, thus the following require
;; statement.

(provide 'balanced)
(require 'balanced)

;; I want a menu-bar option for toggling balanced mode.

(global-set-key [menu-bar tools balance]
		'("Auto-Balance Parens" . balanced-toggle))

;; I can't believe for-each isn't defined in emacs lisp.

;; balanced-modes is an association-list of major-mode names to lists

;; reset the keys for a particular mode, as well as used for unsetting
;; the key modifications.

(defun balanced-on ()
  "Changes a number of key bindings in the current major mode:

  * ``open parenthesis''-type keys (the exact keys depend on the major
    mode) insert both opening and closing characters, and ``close
    parenthesis''-type keys simply move to the nearest closing
    character (not necessarily matching the key typed).  
  * Meta-``open'' and ``close'' are rebound to simply insert the
    corresponding character.
  * ``delete-left''-type keys skip over ``close parenthesis''-type
    characters and only delete them when they can delete a matching
    ``open parenthesis''-type character (a delete can be forced by
    giving the ``delete-left''-type key an argument -- i.e. with
    ctrl-u or something).

If the ``open parenthesis''-type keys are given a numeric argument,
they will wrap their open and close around that many items.  For
example, in lisp modes, if the point is at -!- in:  

      (if (null? x) -!-(printf 3) hi)

then ``Esc 2 ('' will result in

      (if (null? x) (-!-(printf 3) hi))"
